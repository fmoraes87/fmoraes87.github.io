Hi, My name is Fernando, I just see me as a software developer, the thing that most motivate me is a challenge, I've been working with Java for almost 10 years and regardless of it I don't see me as java expert but I can pick up a project and working on it.

For a long time, I've been an open source contributor -  AdempiereLBR / Adempiere/ Idempiere project - and that showed me the community power and how important it can be for us, I still try to follow this project and work with others opensource projects too.

I've decided to keep the Jekyll description. And that it's.

Thank you!
